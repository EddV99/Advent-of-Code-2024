## Building
To build the solutions:
`npm run build`

## Running
To run the solution for a specific day use:
`npm run day 1`

You can also run multiple days if you want: 
`npm run day 1 3`
(This would run the solutions for day 1 and day 3)

If you want to run all solutions just run without any args:
`npm run day`
